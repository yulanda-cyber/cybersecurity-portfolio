# Cyber Risk Quantification Using NIST CSF
## Scenario-Based Financial Risk Modeling



Scenario: Ransomware Attack on Healthcare Organization
Threat Event

External threat actor deploys ransomware through phishing email.

Affected Assets

Electronic Health Record (EHR) system

Patient scheduling platform

Billing systems

Business Impact Categories

Operational downtime

Regulatory fines (HIPAA exposure)

Incident response costs

Reputational damage



Estimated Loss Components
Category	Estimated Range
Downtime (5–10 days)	$250,000 – $900,000
Legal & Compliance	$50,000 – $200,000
IR & Recovery	$100,000 – $400,000
Total Exposure	$400,000 – $1.5M


## Key Takeaways

- Quantified cyber risk must reflect business impact, not just technical severity.
- Financial exposure should be modeled in ranges to account for uncertainty.
- Risk quantification supports executive decision-making and control prioritization.


## Quantifying Risk Using Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE)

To estimate potential financial exposure, and translate this scenario into measurable business impact, the Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) model can be applied.


### Formula

ALE = Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO) × Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)

Where:

- **Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO)** = Estimated probability of the event occurring within one year  
- **Single Loss Expectancy (SLE)** = Estimated financial impact of a single incident  

---

### Scenario Application: Ransomware Attack

Estimated Single Loss Expectancy (SLE):

- Operational downtime (7 days): $600,000  
- Legal and regulatory costs: $150,000  
- Incident response and recovery: $250,000  

Total Estimated Impact (SLE): $1,000,000  

Estimated Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO): 0.20 (20% likelihood per year)

---

### Calculation

ALE = 0.20 × $1,000,000  
ALE = $200,000  

---

### Interpretation

The organization’s estimated annualized financial exposure from ransomware is **$200,000 per year**.

This quantified value supports:

- Security investment decisions  
- Cyber insurance evaluation  
- Control prioritization  
- Risk acceptance discussions
