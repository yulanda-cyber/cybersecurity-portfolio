Cyber Risk Quantification Using NIST CSF  
  Demonstrates scenario-based financial risk modeling aligned to NIST framework functions.
Project Overview

This project demonstrates how cyber risk can be quantified using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) aligned with structured financial impact estimation methods.

The objective is to move beyond qualitative “High/Medium/Low” scoring and model cyber risk in measurable business terms.

🎯 Objectives

Align cyber risk quantification with NIST CSF functions

Model financial impact using scenario-based analysis

Demonstrate common pitfalls in risk quantification

Show how quantified risk informs business decisions

🧩 Framework Used

NIST CSF (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover)

Scenario-based risk modeling

Financial impact estimation ranges
